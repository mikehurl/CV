# Mike Hurl

An aspiring developer with significant experience in the education field and with administrative tasks. In all situations I am patient, calm and level-headed. I adapt quickly and effectively to new situations and have a proven record of achieving in high-pressure environments.

My programming journey has started with joining Makers Academy, an extremely selective coding bootcamp where typically only one in ten applicants begin the course. As a life-long learner, I also completed a diploma in my early twenties; obtained a first-class degree at 30, studying for two years in the evening whilst working as a primary school classroom assistant during the day; and completed a PGCE, an intense nine-month teacher training programme.

I not only want to develop with code, I also want to continue to develop myself. As such, I want to work in an environment that will support my natural curiosity and desire to keep learning. At the same time, I am hoping to solve problems with like-minded individuals who will both support and push me as a developer.

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my working life, I have been a confident communicator in numerous contexts, with said contexts also further developing my communication skills. Working as a temp in the civil service, I have drafted letters for government ministers and answered emails and telephone calls from members of the public. At two universities I was a student representative, listening to concerns from peers and feeding back to university staff. Whilst teaching, I line managed other adults who were providing support to certain pupils in the classroom; delivered lessons to six and seven-year old children and wrote school reports for their parents. During my time in the recruitment field, I interviewed prospective temporary workers over the telephone and in person; outlined expectations and useful information to candidates; and acted as a general sounding-board for my line-manager due to being trusted, well-informed and thoughtful.

#### Problem Solving

I find it particularly satisfying to solve problems. As a recruiter, many of my suggestions around certain recruitment and administrative processes were sought out taken on board. The interviewing procedures as I left the company are significantly different to when I joined.  Whilst my line manager was on maternity leave, I was instrumental during the process to replace other members of the team who quit during this period of time; being solely responsible for interviewing one prospective employee and jointly responsible with a line manager of another team for the second. As a teacher I regularly devised, considered and provided solutions in various circumstances. This would range from more mundane instances, such as management of low-level disruptive behaviour, to determining the best way to provide suitable learning experiences and to be confident that the lessons have successfully been taken on board as desired.
