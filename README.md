### Profile

A novice developer with significant experience in the education field and with administrative tasks. In all situations I am patient, calm and level-headed. I adapt quickly and effectively to new situations and have a proven record of achieving in high-pressure environments.

My programming journey has started with joining Makers Academy (MA), an extremely selective coding bootcamp where typically only one in twelve applicants begin the course. As a life-long learner, I have also completed a diploma in my early twenties; obtained a first-class degree at 30, studying for two years in the evening whilst working as a primary school classroom assistant during the day; and completed a PGCE, an intensive nine-month teacher training programme.

I not only want to develop with code, I also want to continue to develop myself. As such, I want to work in an environment that will support my natural curiosity and desire to keep learning. At the same time, in order to build things of value,  I am hoping to solve problems with like-minded individuals who will both support and push me as a developer.

### Skills

#### Communication

Working as a temp in the civil service, I have drafted letters for government ministers and answered emails and telephone calls from members of the public. At two universities I was a student representative, listening to concerns from peers and feeding back to staff. Whilst teaching, I line-managed adults who supported certain pupils in the classroom; delivered lessons to six and seven-year old children and wrote school reports for their parents. In the recruitment field, I interviewed prospective temporary workers over the telephone and in person; outlined expectations and useful information to candidates; and acted as a general sounding-board for my line manager due to being trusted, well-informed and thoughtful. At Makers Academy we followed pair programming practices, and as such I worked and studied with a different individual on my cohort every day. This entailed being able to discuss understanding of new concepts as well as sharing problems and possible solutions. Alongside this, every day would consist of a stand-up or retro where we would reflect on and discuss previous learning and blocks to understanding.

#### Problem Solving

As a recruiter, my suggestions around certain problematic recruitment and administrative processes were sought out. Whilst my line manager was on maternity leave, I was instrumental during the process to replace other members of the team who quit during this period of time; being solely responsible for interviewing one prospective employee and jointly responsible with a line manager of another team for the second. As a teacher I devised, considered and provided solutions in many circumstances. This ranged from more mundane instances, such as management of low-level disruptive behaviour, to providing suitable learning experiences and being confident that the lessons have successfully been taken on board as desired. As a Makers Academy student, my entire time was centred around the solving of problems, usually following test driven development practices. Each week consisted of a new challenge to introduce us to and further our understanding of concepts and best practice. Every weekend consisted of another challenge, working individually in order to consolidate that weekâ€™s learning.
